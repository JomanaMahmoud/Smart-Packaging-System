# 🚀 **Smart Packaging System** 📦

The **Smart Packaging System** is an automated conveyor belt solution designed to optimize the packaging process for factories producing magnetic products. By leveraging sensor-based automation, this system enhances efficiency and ensures safe operations. ⚙️✨

## 🌟 Features

1. **Automatic Product Counting** 🔢
   - Tracks the number of magnetic products on the conveyor belt using a Hall effect sensor. 🧲
   - Displays the count on a 7-segment display for real-time monitoring. 📊

2. **Conveyor Belt Control** 🚂
   - Stops the belt automatically once the product count reaches the maximum limit (5 products). 🚫

3. **Worker Proximity Detection** 👷‍♂️
   - Uses an IR sensor to detect if a worker is nearby. 🤖
   - Alerts workers to secure the package if no one is detected near the belt. ⚠️

4. **System Reset** 🔄
   - Provides a switch for workers to resume belt operation after packaging. 🔄
   - Resets the product count to zero for the next cycle. 🔄

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. The conveyor belt moves magnetic products and counts them using the Hall effect sensor. 🏗️
2. The real-time count is displayed on the 7-segment display. 📱
3. When the count reaches 5, the belt automatically stops. 🛑
4. The system checks for worker proximity using the IR sensor. 📡
   - If no worker is nearby, an alert is triggered. 🔔
5. Once the worker secures the package, they use a switch to resume operation and reset the count. 🔄
